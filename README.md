LUADEXPRESS is a web application built along with our study "Molecular characterization, biological function, tumor microenvironment association, and clinical significance of m6A regulators in lung adenocarcinoma". It is designed to facilitate data mining and maximize the value of publicly available expression data of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. Currently, there are more than 2,500 samples from 15 independent LUAD studies available in LUADEXPRESS. The major functions of LUADEXPRESS consist of seven modules, including Expression, Survival, Correlation, Dependency, Diagnosis, Prognosis, and PD-L1.
